Last week's accomplishments:

Last week I finished a chapter of Codecademy with lessons on Nested Elements, Chaining and Specificity, and Multiple Selectors.
I worked with another teammate on the conceptual design and layout for course themes.

This week's plan:

This week I plan to continue working on the logistics for both the Statistics page and the course themes. This includes generating
actual personalized data, and coding the colors into the setup page.

Anything blocking:

This week is Spring break so I won't be seeing my groupmates until we come back to school.
