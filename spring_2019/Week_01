Last week's accomplishments:

I learned how to make commits on Github since I am new to programming. I set up my LATE account, have gotten familiar with the site,
and have been actively using LATE. I noticed that long links continued off the width of the screen without the option to scroll,
so I fixed it by having the text break onto a new line. In my sub-group we came up with the idea of a Statistics page,
and discussed its layout and content.

This week's plan:

This week I will work with my subgroup to further design and start implementation of the stats page. We are figuring out how it
should be displayed and what algorithms we will use with the data we have to generate these statistics. I am going to continue progressing
in my CSS course on Codecademy.

Anything blocking:

I am not a CS/CSE major and have very limited experience with coding and I am in Computer Science I right now. To help me with this,
I am going to start learning CSS on Codeacademy. I enrolled in the "Learn CSS" class and have completed the first 5 lessons in
Module 1 Chapter 1: Intro to CSS, Inline Styles, the <style> tag, the .css file, and Linking the CSS file.
