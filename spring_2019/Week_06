Last week's accomplishments:

I started writing the code for LATE's tour. I decided what parts of the website should be introduced in the tour, what the
tour should say, etc. I also learned about CSS Visual concepts including Font family, font size, font weight, text align, color,
opacity, and background images.

This week's plan:

This week I plan to continue working on the tour content and start testing out how it actually works and will look.
I will need to create IDs for some parts.

Anything blocking:

Some things I want to add tour content for do not have ID's so I will need to learn how to create IDs.
