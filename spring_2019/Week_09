Last week's accomplishments:

I installed Ubuntu, Node, and a few other programs so now I can test code directly instead of going through Github. I learned how
to create and edit charts using charts.js and how to pull a user's data from LATE to put into the chart. I also made the suggested
assignments unique.

This week's plan:
I am currently creating a test chart displaying the number of assignemnts per class and am finalizing how it looks. This week I am going
to continue with the Statistics page and creating additional charts. Also going to implement the tour.

Anything blocking:
I just learned this stuff so that's why it's coming along slow, but it's coming along!
