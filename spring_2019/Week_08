Last week's accomplishments:

I learned how to create ID's and created them for parts of the tour that did not have them. 

This week's plan:

This week I will work on starting to finalize the tour and finding the best way to test it out. I also want to revisit some older
issues that are still open and work on those.

Anything blocking:

I do not have the proper software to test out the tour so need to figure out how to go about testing.
