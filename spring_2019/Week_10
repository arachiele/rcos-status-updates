Last week's accomplishments:

I created some charts for the Statistics page, such as number of assignments per class and assignments over time. I am continuing
to write up charts with other data as well.

This week's plan:

I am going to continue working on the charts by editing some and adding some more. I also want to fix the page layout and make it
better by adding columns and an overview header.

Anything blocking:

Not sure how to format charts to be thinner overall so we can display them in columns, hopefully I can figure that out this week.
