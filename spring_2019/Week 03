Last week's accomplishments:

Last week I continued Codecademy with lessons on Specificity and Chaining Selectors. I taught myself how to create buttons in LATE's
code. I created a few color schemes on Adobe Color CC. The stats group decided which data to use for certain statistics, and updated
our plan for layout design.

This week's plan:

The statistics team is going to assign smaller tasks to each group member to start implementation. I am still trying to figure out how
to code and implement color templates. Continuing progress on learning CSS.

Anything blocking:

We missed 2 meetings bc of Monday schedule & snow day, so are a little behind on our subgroup meetings. Dividing up individual tasks
should help us catch up for this.
