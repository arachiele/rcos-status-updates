Last week's accomplishments: 
Last week I continued progressing on Codecademy CSS lessons on: Tag Name, Class name, multiple classes, ID name, and Classes and IDs.
Our statistics team subgroup had a meeting where we drew up some design plans for the page.
I started creating color templates that will be used upon user account setup to display courses in a personalized way instead of being
randomly assigned.

This week's plan:
I will continue designing these templates for courses and hope to figure out how to implement this. After using LATE for a bit,
I have a few enhancement ideas that I will open up issues for on Github and start working on. The statistics team will continue
writing algorithms and focusing on implementation.

Anything blocking:
Not exactly sure how to implement the course templates, so I will be figuring that out. Continuing with learning CSS! I am also a little
confused on how to find certain files on Github, so will try learning how to better navigate the repository.
