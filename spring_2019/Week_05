Last week's accomplishments:

Last week I updated the README by adding pictures/descriptions of LATE, for which I learned Markdown. I then resized the images,
which I learned to do using HTML. I started a new Codecademy chapter on Visual Rules, including the Structure of CSS and Font Families. 
I discussed the feasibility of some enhancement ideas with Frank.

This week's plan:

This week I plan to start creating a tour of LATE using Vue. I will need to learn the syntax for doing this first and I will need
to figure out what content should be included.

Anything blocking:

Busy weekend.
