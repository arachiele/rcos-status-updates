Last week's accomplishments:

I continued adding parts to LATE's tour and learned to use a new program to write code. I also learned about the
CSS Box Model and some of its features like Heigh and Width, Borders, and Border Radius.

This week's plan:

This week I plan to continue working on the tour content. I will work with a teammate to start implementation. 

Anything blocking:

Had a bunch of exams this week.
