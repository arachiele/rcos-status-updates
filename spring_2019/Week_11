Last week's accomplishments:

I completed Codeacademy lessons on Foreground/Background, Hexadecimal, RGB colors, Hue/Saturation, and Opacity. Also continued
with Stats code / layout / concepts.

This week's plan:

I plan to continue adding some more charts, improving the page layout, working on Codeacademy, and making some updates to Stats
by adding data besides the ones charts.

Anything blocking:

Need to figure out how to do most of this, but it shall be figured out! 

PS: Thanks for a great first semester, I learned so much!
